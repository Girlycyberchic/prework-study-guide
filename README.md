# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a bootcamp student it is important for me to keep my notes in one place. 
Creating a webpage serves as both a great place to keep notes as well as to practice what I'm learning in bootcamp.
This process helped me learn the basics of using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git as well as the importance of version control and using GitHub.

In the DevTools is a list of the topics learned during prework and a topic can be chosen at random for study.
